    <!-- Section 19: FOD Check -->
    <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-header">🛫 19. FOD Check</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, I keep hearing about FOD checks. What exactly is FOD?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> FOD stands for Foreign Object Debris. Basically, anything that shouldn’t be on the ramp—stones, plastic, tools, even an old boarding pass blowing in the wind.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Seriously? That stuff can cause problems?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Absolutely. One loose bolt can turn into a flying bullet once an engine fires up. FOD may be small, but it plays dirty.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> What about a sandwich wrapper? That sounds harmless!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Tell that to an engine sucking it in at full throttle. That "harmless" wrapper could cost millions. FOD may be small, but its impact? Huge.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> what about water bottle?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Yep. One bottle sucked into a jet engine and boom—cha-ching! That’s one very expensive drink.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it. So when do we check for FOD?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Three times: pre-arrival, pre-departure, and post-departure. Think of it like a safety checklist—we check, then check again, then check after we’ve checked.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> And who’s responsible for that?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Everyone at the bay. No exceptions. If you’re breathing ramp air, you’re part of the FOD squad.</p></p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Alright! What should I be looking for exactly?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Anything that doesn’t belong—bolts, tools, plastics, lost items. If you wouldn’t want it flying into a jet engine, it’s FOD. When in doubt, pick it out!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it, Mr. Krish,! Eyes down, pockets empty, ramp clean!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> That’s the spirit! A clean ramp is a safe ramp. Let’s keep the jets happy—and off the snack diet!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Okay! And what do we do with the stuff we find?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Straight into the FOD bin. Every bay has one. Can’t miss it—it’s the bin that’s practically begging for attention.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> And if the bin’s not there?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Head over to the passenger ramp—we’ve got an FOD bin there too. No excuses. The only thing flying should be the aircraft, not garbage.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Copy that, Mr. Krish,! FOD in the bin, not in the engine!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Now you’re talking! Clean ramp, safe skies—that’s how we roll.

        <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, I’ve got toilet cart duty today. Anything special I need to know about hygiene?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Oh yes—this is where cleanliness is king. When you're done, all <em>used disposable gloves and masks</em> must go straight into the <em>biohazard bin</em>. No shortcuts, no detours.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Can I toss in some regular trash too, just to save time?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Absolutely not! The biohazard bin is strictly for <em>PPE like gloves and masks</em>—nothing else. Mixing in regular waste? That’s a contamination party nobody wants.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it. Toss it right, toss it safe.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly. And don’t forget to <em>check the bin lid</em> after disposing—make sure it’s properly closed. An open bio bin is like an open invitation for trouble.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> What if the bin’s full or cracked?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Then <em>report it immediately</em>. We can’t keep things clean if the container’s broken. Safety’s everyone’s job—even when it comes to bins.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Alright. Gloves off, bin closed, and no funny business with the trash.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> That’s the spirit! Stay clean, stay safe, and keep airside contamination-free.</p>

            <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, what’s the difference between jet ingest and jet blast? I keep mixing them up!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Good question! Jet ingest is like the engine’s vacuum cleaner—it sucks in air and anything nearby at the front. So, stay clear or you might get “swallowed”!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, what’s the difference between jet ingest and jet blast? Specifically, what happens behind the engine?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Behind the engine is where jet blast happens—it’s a fierce gust of air shooting out the back. Stand there, and you could get knocked over or hit by flying debris.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> How close can I safely get to these zones?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> When the engine’s on, keep at least 5.79 meters from the front—that’s the ingest danger zone. And from the rear, a safe 60 meters away to avoid the blast. Think of it as giving the engine its personal space!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Now I’m clear—it’s like respecting a grumpy giant!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! Respect the giant, stay alert, stay outside ERA when engine is on and you’ll be safe on the ramp every time.</p>

          </div>
<p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, when is it actually safe to approach the aircraft at the bay? I don’t want to be the guy who walks into a spinning propeller!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Good question! Think of the aircraft like a sleeping dragon—you don’t want to wake it up too soon. Wait until the engines are off, ACB is turned off, chocks are in place, and the engineer gives the thumbs up.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> By the way, where exactly is the ACB located? I want to be sure I’m checking the right place.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Great to ask! On an Airbus, the ACBs are located on top and bottom of the fuselage. For ATR aircraft, you’ll find them on top of the tail and also on the bottom of the fuselage. Knowing this helps you verify that the ACB is properly turned off before approaching.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Wait, what exactly is the fuselage?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Ah, good one! The fuselage is basically the main body of the aircraft — the big central part where the Customers sit and the cargo is stored. Think of it like the airplane’s torso.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So basically, if ACB is on and  I rush in, I’m asking for trouble?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! Patience is your best safety gear here. Approaching too early is like trying to hug a cactus—painful and unnecessary.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it, I’ll personally check the engines, ACB locations, and chocks before waiting for the engineer’s “all clear.” No cactus hugs for me!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Perfect! Safe, smart, and with no prickly surprises. You’re officially on the express train to ramp training greatness!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Thank you! Credits to you for putting up with all my questions — you deserve a medal... or at least a really big coffee!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Haha, no medal needed — just remember: patience is key, and if you survive my jokes, you’re ready for anything!</p>  <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Remember:</p> <ul> <li>A/C engines are off</li> <li>ACB is turned off (on Airbus: top & bottom of fuselage; on ATR: top of tail & bottom of fuselage)</li> <li>Chocks are in place</li> <li>Engineer gives the thumbs up</li> </ul>

              </div>
            <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, how many cones do we use for the Airbus A320 and the ATR?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Great question! For the A320, you place 11 cones around the aircraft, like little sentinels guarding the plane. The ATR gets 10 cones—almost like a VIP rope line but with cones!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Nice! And what about chocks? How many do we need for each?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> In normal weather, the A320 uses 8 chocks—four on each wheel, making sure the plane stays put like a stubborn mule. The ATR uses 6 chocks, keeping things tight and safe.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> What if the wind decides to mess with us? Do we need more chocks?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Absolutely! If the wind speed goes above 25 knots, the A320 gets 4 extra chocks, making a total of 12. That’s like calling in backup to hold the plane steady. The ATR sticks with 6 chocks—tough little plane!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> What about the cones? Do we keep them all when it’s windy?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Nope! If wind speed is above 25 knots, cones have to be removed. Leaving them out is like giving the wind some bowling pins—definitely dangerous for everyone on the ramp!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So cones and chocks are like the bodyguards of the plane, huh?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! Without them, our planes might just roll away or get too cozy with the neighbors. Safety first, always!</p><p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Here’s a quick reference table for you to review. Make sure to study it well—it will be part of your assessment.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">
           <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, what’s this windchart thing everyone keeps checking?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Ah, the windchart—it’s our airside weather watchdog. It shows <em>real-time wind speed and direction</em>. Sounds simple, but it’s absolutely critical for safe aircraft ops, especially during <em>takeoff, landing, and taxiing</em>.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So, it’s not just for pilots?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Nope—<em>ground crew rely on it too</em>. It tells us when to start locking things down. For example: at <em>25–39 knots</em>, secure any loose items. At <em>40 knots and above</em>, start tying down equipment. And if wind hits <em>60 knots</em>—some operations must <em>stop completely</em>.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it. Wind up = lock it down.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly. Think of it as a speedometer for safety. The higher the wind, the more careful we get. And you must <em>check the windchart</em> during these critical points: <em>before arrival, before departure, and during taxiing</em>.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> What if the chart looks off or isn’t working?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> <em>Report it immediately.</em> Faulty data is dangerous data. We don’t guess with safety—we verify and act accordingly.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Makes sense. Windchart = checklist item, every time.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> You got it. Keep your eyes on the chart and your hands on safety—it’s non-negotiable out here.</p>

            <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, all aircraft kinda look the same from the ground. How do I tell them apart?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Ah, my young ramp warrior, knowing your aircraft is like recognizing your relatives at a wedding—look closely, they all have unique features!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Okay, let's start with the A320?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> The A320 is your standard short-haul hero—180 to 186 customers, 4 doors, and 3 cargo holds. Think of it as the "Toyota" of aircraft. Reliable and everywhere.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> And the A321?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> That’s the A320’s big brother with more muscle—222 to 232 customers, 6 doors, and 5 compartments. Longer and leaner. If the A320 is a sedan, the A321 is a limo.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> What about the ATR? That one looks... different.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Yup! The ATR is the countryside cousin—smaller with 78 customers, 1 door, and a quirky 2 holds, 4-compartment hold setup. Props not jets. And the ACB lights? One on the tail and one under the belly, like a plane with a nightlight!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> And the Airbuses have their ACB lights?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Right—both top and bottom of the fuselage. Easy to spot if you know where to look. Like aircraft bling!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it! So it’s all about doors, lavs, holds, and the plane’s personality!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! If you know your aircraft, the ramp becomes a lot less confusing—and way more fun.</p>

Think of the A321 as the A320’s taller cousin who grew longer by 7 meters—and needs a different set of doors to stretch them out.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So what doors do I need to remember?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> For the A320, it's L1, L2, and R1—like a cozy 3-room apartment. For the A321, it's L1, L4, and l4—because the A321 threw a party and added a door at the back!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Why L4 for A321 though? That’s way back!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly. The A321 is longer, so using L4 helps with faster boarding and deplaning—no traffic jams in the aisle. It's like opening both ends of a subway car during rush hour.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Makes sense. So, just memorize the combo, right?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Yep! Treat it like a cheat code: A320 = L1, L2, R1. A321 = L1, L4, R1. No guessing, just winning.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">
<img src="img/hotelmode.png" alt="hotelmode">
            <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, I saw someone mention “Hotel Mode” on the ATR. Are we checking into a flying hotel now?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Ha! Not quite. “Hotel Mode” sounds fancy, but it just means the aircraft is using its APU to power systems while the engines are off in Airbus. In ATR, we do not have APU, so we use a different method.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So… it’s like turning on the lights and AC in the plane without starting the engines?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! Since the ATR doesn’t have an APU, it uses its own right-side engine—Engine No. 2—to generate power. This is what we call Hotel Mode in the ATR.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Wait, the engine is on? Isn’t that risky on the ground?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Good question. Yes, Engine 2 is running, but its **propeller is feathered and held stationary using a propeller brake**. That means the engine can produce power, but the propeller doesn’t spin.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> What does “feathered” mean?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Think of it this way: If you stick your hand flat out a car window, the wind pushes hard—lots of resistance. But if you turn your hand sideways, the air slips past easily. That’s what feathering does. It turns the propeller blades edge-on to the airflow, reducing drag and stopping it from spinning. Then, a propeller brake keeps it fully still.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Ah, so the engine runs to give power, but the propeller doesn’t move. Got it!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly. This allows electrical and pneumatic systems like lights, avionics, and air conditioning to work, without starting both engines.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> But is Hotel Mode after the GPU is connected?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Nope! In Hotel Mode, the aircraft powers itself. If it’s using a GPU, that’s external power—not Hotel Mode. Think of Hotel Mode as the aircraft making its own coffee without room service.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So GPU is room service, and Hotel Mode is the plane brewing its own coffee?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Nailed it! The ATR uses its right engine in Hotel Mode to be self-sufficient on the ground—no external power needed.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Is it safe to work around the plane in Hotel Mode?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Safer than when engines are running, yes. But always remember—the exhaust from the running engine is hot, and systems are live. Stay alert, wear PPE, and treat the aircraft with respect.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Copy that. Hotel Mode: Customers relax, ramp crew sweat… with caution!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Welcome to aviation!</p>

        <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, I keep hearing about the LDM—what exactly is it?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Ah, the LDM! That’s the Load Distribution Message. Think of it like a recipe card for the aircraft—it tells us where the “ingredients” (customers, cargo, baggage) are placed so the plane doesn’t turn into a flying seesaw.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Flying seesaw?!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! If we load too much in the back, the nose points up. Too much in the front, and the tail gets jealous. The LDM helps balance the load—so we fly smooth and happy.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So, it’s like weightlifting for planes—keep it balanced or things go sideways.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Spot on!

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, what exactly is an LIR? Sounds like a secret mission code.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Ha! Not quite James Bond, but it is important. LIR stands for Load Instruction Report. It tells you what goes where on the aircraft—kind of like a recipe for loading a plane.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So it’s like the plane’s grocery list?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> More like its diet plan. It says how much cargo, where it should be loaded, and in what order—so the aircraft stays balanced and doesn’t do an unplanned backflip.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> That would definitely ruin someone’s vacation.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! That’s why the LIR must be followed *exactly* as printed. No freelancing, no guessing. Even small mistakes can throw off the aircraft’s center of gravity.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it! Follow the LIR like it’s gospel.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Right! Treat it like your playlist at the gym—no skipping, no shuffling. Load it as written, and the plane stays happy—and so do the customers.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Makes sense. But what’s actually in the LIR? Like, what columns or info should I be looking at?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Good question. The LIR is usually divided into three main columns. First, there's the <strong>Arrival Load</strong>—that shows the cargo, mail, and baggage already on the aircraft when it arrives.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So that’s what’s staying onboard?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly. Then comes the <strong>Planned Loading</strong>—that’s what we intend to load for the departing flight: more cargo, mail, and checked baggage.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it. And the third column?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> The third column is <strong>Final Loading</strong>. That’s what actually made it onto the aircraft after check-in counters close. It's the confirmed, real deal—no more changes after that.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So Arrival Load, Planned Loading, and Final Loading. Three columns telling us what’s on, what’s going in, and what finally made it.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Bingo! Think of it as past, present, and confirmed future. Every item has to be loaded according to plan—or else we update the plan and make sure it's approved before the door shuts.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Understood, Mr. Krish,. No surprises for the aircraft!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> That’s the spirit. The LIR keeps the aircraft balanced, efficient, and most importantly—safe.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, I saw a HUM package last shift. What's the proper way to handle it?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Ah, the HUM—Human Remains. It’s serious business. We show respect, care, and follow procedure to the letter.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it. So, where do we load it on the aircraft?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> On an Airbus, it goes into the bulk hold, which is the 5th compartment. Think of it as first-class cargo with VIP treatment—quiet, secure, and head always facing the nose of the aircraft.</p><p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, quick question—why does the HUM’s head need to face the nose of the aircraft?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Good question! It's not just for respect, though that's part of it. It’s also for science—and gravity.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Gravity? What’s that got to do with it?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> During takeoff and most of the flight, the aircraft's nose is slightly elevated. That means the tail is a bit lower.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Oh… like a permanent uphill?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! So if the HUM is placed with the head toward the nose, any bodily fluids naturally settle away from the head. It’s about maintaining dignity and avoiding, well… internal messes.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Ahhh, so it’s like putting a lid on a cup before you tip it—smart.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Right! The HUM may not complain, but we still treat them with care and respect. Always head toward the nose. No exceptions.</p><p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Ha! Noted. Anything else I should watch for?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Yep—two safety straps. Think of them like seatbelts for HUM. No bumpy rides. And always follow the labels—if it says "This Side Up," don’t get creative.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Makes sense. So… no upside-down HUMs?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Absolutely not. We’re not in a horror movie. Respect, care, and correct handling—always.</p>

          <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, what exactly is a “hazard” on the ramp?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Great question! A hazard is anything that could cause trouble—like a slippery patch, a broken light, or even a rogue wrench lying around. Basically, it’s trouble waiting to happen.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Okay, and what’s the difference between an incident and an accident then?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Think of an incident as a close call—like you almost tripped but caught yourself. An accident is when you actually do trip and fall, or something breaks or someone gets hurt.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it. So, if I see something like a crack on the aircraft engine while working, what should I do?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> You shout “Heads up!”—just kidding. You report it immediately to the Aircraft Engineer and the Safety Team. No heroics, just quick action!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> What if I spot a damaged equipment or a vehicle parked under the aerobridge?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> For damaged equipment, call the GSE (Ground Support Equipment) team and Safety. For that vehicle under the aerobridge, ring up the Agile staff and Safety to get it moved pronto.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> And how do we report these hazards properly?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Easy! We have an SMS form at the backup office—you fill that out. Also, on 6E Breez, you’ll find hazard reporting available digitally. Reporting is your superpower to keep everyone safe!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So basically, see something dangerous, report it fast?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! When it comes to safety, slow is a no-go. Report fast, keep calm, and carry on safely!</p>

  </div>
            <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, today’s topic is disability, right?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Yep! And no, it’s not just about someone using a wheelchair. Disability is a broad umbrella—it covers way more than you’d expect.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Like what?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Let’s roll through 20 common types, and no, you don’t need to memorize them all—just understand and respect them.</p>

<p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Whoa! That’s quite a list. So, what’s my role here on the ramp?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Your job? Respect, support, and don’t assume. Just because someone looks fine doesn’t mean they aren’t facing challenges.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it! So, empathy and awareness are part of the PPE too?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! A good attitude weighs nothing and fits every size. Wear it every day.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, I saw so many different boarding passes today—some on phones, some on paper. What’s the deal?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Ah, welcome to the boarding pass buffet! There’s one for every taste. Let’s go over the menu.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Sounds tasty. What’s the first item?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> <em>Web Check-in Boarding Pass</em>. Customers check in online and download or print it. It’s like ordering food before reaching the restaurant—saves time and reduces the drama.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> What if they don’t do it online?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Then we have the <em>Kiosk Boarding Pass</em>. These are printed by the passenger using self-service machines at the airport. It’s like a vending machine—but for boarding!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Oh, I’ve seen people scanning their faces. Is that magic?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> That’s <em>DigiYatra</em>. Biometric-based boarding pass—just face scan and go. The future has arrived, and it’s looking right at you!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> And what about the old-school ones?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> You mean the <em>Counter Issued Boarding Pass</em>. Printed by airline staff at the check-in counter. It's classic—like vinyl records. Still used and still cool.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> And manual ones? I heard someone say “paper and pen boarding pass.” That real?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Oh yes, the <em>Manual Boarding Pass</em>—used only when systems crash. Think of it as the emergency candle when the lights go out. Rare, but you better know how to use it!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it! So, all passes lead to the plane?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! Just like all jokes lead to a groan. But remember—no matter the pass, always check names, flight number, and gate. No one wants to end up in the wrong city... unless you’re into spontaneous vacations!</p>

         <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, I keep hearing about different types of wheelchairs on the ramp. Why so many types?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Think of wheelchairs like cars—different models for different jobs. We have WCHC, WCHR, and the special one called the Ostrich wheelchair. Each one has its own style and purpose.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Ostrich wheelchair? Is it faster than the others?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong>Not exactly! It's called that because it helps customers reach rows 21 to 37 or 39 on an A321 aircraft, where the cabin becomes narrower toward the rear.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Cool! So, how do I know which wheelchair to use?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Always check the SSR on the boarding pass. That’s your secret code telling you which wheelchair to use. It’s like the GPS for wheelchairs!</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it! Check SSR, pick the right wheelchair, and keep everyone comfortable and safe. Easy!</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly! Now you’re ready to roll—pun intended!</p>

           <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Mr. Krish, what do I do if a customer gets really upset at the airport?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> First, stay calm—and definitely don’t take it personally. Inform your Manager on Duty (MOD) and try to ease the situation with a calm tone and helpful attitude.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> And if the customer still seems unhappy and walks away?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Whether they leave the airport or board the flight looking unsatisfied, you <em>must</em> report it to <strong>PSHD</strong>—the Priority Service Helpdesk. They’re trained to follow up and support the customer even after they’ve left your area.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> What exactly do I need to tell PSHD?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Good question. You’ll need to share: – The customer’s <em>name</em> – Their <em>PNR</em> (booking reference) – A brief description of the <em>issue</em> – What <em>service recovery</em> was offered at the airport (like assistance, alternate solution, refreshments, or an apology)</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> So just a quick and clear summary?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Exactly. PSHD doesn’t need an essay—just enough information to understand the situation and take it forward smoothly.</p> <p><strong>Trainee:</strong> Got it! So I stay composed, do what I can, inform my manager, and then give PSHD the details if needed?</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Perfect! You handle the moment—they handle the follow-up. It's all about making the customer feel heard and cared for, even after the interaction ends.</p>
