  <h2>1. Why is Ramp Safety Training Important?</h2>
     <img src="img/rs.jpeg" alt="Ramp Area Overview" class="standard-img">
  <p>
    The ramp is like a busy road with airplanes, baggage carts, fuel trucks, and people all moving at once. 
    Ramp safety training teaches how to stay safe in this fast-moving area. By staying alert and following safety rules, 
    we can avoid accidents and keep ground operations running smoothly.
  </p>
 
 <h2>2. What Does RAMP Stand For?</h2>
  <p>
    RAMP means <strong>Region of Aircraft Movement and Parking</strong>. 
    It is the area where aircraft are parked, refueled, loaded, maintained, and moved. 
    All important ground work happens in this zone.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Airside vs Landside</h2>
  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="img/landside.jpg" alt="Landside Area" class="standard-img">
    <img src="img/airside.png" alt="Airside Area" class="standard-img">
  </div>

  <p>
    The airport is divided into two main areas: <strong>Landside</strong> and <strong>Airside</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Landside</strong> is the public area. It includes places like ticket counters, check-in areas, and where Customers wait before security checks. 
    It is calm and more organized, but you still need to be alert and careful.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Airside</strong> is the restricted and high-activity zone. Only trained staff and authorized people are allowed here. 
    This is where aircraft are parked, refueled, loaded, and serviced. It is busy, fast-paced, and needs full attention and safety awareness.
  </p>

  <p>
    To work on the airside, you must follow strict procedures, wear your PPE, and always be alert. 
    Communication and teamwork are also very important to stay safe and get the job done right.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you are in the terminal (landside) or on the ramp (airside), both areas are important and need focus. 
    One side is full of customers, the other full of planes—both need your attention and safety skills.

  <h2>4. Landside Access vs Airside Access</h2>
  <img src="img/aep.png" alt="Access Areas" style="width: 625px; height: 333px; object-fit: cover;" class="standard-img">


  <p>
    The airport has two types of access: <strong>Landside Access</strong> and <strong>Airside Access</strong>. 
    Landside is open to Customers and visitors. It includes areas like ticket counters and waiting lounges.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Airside Access</strong> is restricted. Only authorized staff with a valid permit can enter. This area includes ramps, runways, and other sensitive zones.
  </p>

  <p>
    To enter airside, you need an <strong>AEP</strong>, which stands for <em>Aerodrome Entry Permit</em>. 
    This permit is like your special key or backstage pass to get into the restricted zone.
  </p>

  <p>
    You must always carry your AEP and wear it visibly. Without it, you cannot work or enter the airside. 
    Forgetting your AEP is like trying to get into a concert without a ticket—it won’t be allowed!
  </p>

  <p>
    Always make sure your AEP is valid and not expired. Wearing your AEP proudly shows that you belong in the airside area and are authorized to work there.
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember: safety and security come first. Follow all rules and keep your AEP visible at all times.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Airside Terminology vs Landside Terminology</h2>
  <img src="img/access.png" alt="Airside and Landside Terms" class="standard-img">

  <p>
    At the airport, both airside and landside have their own special words to describe areas and things.
  </p>

  <p>
    A <strong>bay</strong> is like a parking spot for planes. Each plane has its own bay where it parks to load, unload, and refuel.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>apron</strong> is the whole area where many bays are together. It is like the plane’s dressing room where it gets ready for takeoff.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>ERA (Equipment Restraint Area)</strong> is a special zone where only certain ground vehicles can park, kept neat like a VIP parking lot.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>aerobridge</strong> is the tunnel that Customers use to walk from the terminal to the plane. It’s the plane’s front porch.
  </p>

  <p>
    You might see signs like <em>"No Parking, No Standing"</em> under the aerobridge. This is to keep the area clear so ground crew can work safely.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>TCL (Tail Clearance Line)</strong> is a safety line that makes sure the plane’s tail stays inside a safe zone to avoid collisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>service road</strong> is for airport vehicles that move around the apron. It has a speed limit of 15 km/h and is marked with white lines.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>taxiway</strong> is like a road for planes to move between the runway and the apron.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>runway</strong> is where planes take off and land—the airport’s main stage.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>maneuvering area</strong> includes both runways and taxiways. It’s only for moving aircraft—no parking allowed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>perimeter wall</strong> surrounds the airport to keep unauthorized people and animals out. It’s the airport’s security fence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Vehicles on the apron must follow a speed limit of 30 km/h for safety.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>safety diamond</strong> is an imaginary area around the plane marked with cones. Vehicles must move very slowly here (5 km/h) to protect the plane.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yellow lines on the ground guide the plane to park correctly. The <strong>center line</strong> helps steer the plane, and the <strong>stop point</strong> is where the plane’s nose wheel must stop precisely.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because planes don’t have side mirrors, <strong>wing walkers</strong> help guide the wings safely, making sure nothing gets hit.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Landside</strong> refers to the public areas like ticket counters, check-in, and arrivals. It’s where Customers start and end their journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    A <strong>reservation</strong> means you have a confirmed seat on a flight. No reservation, no boarding.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>check-in counter</strong> is where Customers drop off bags and get boarding passes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>arrivals</strong> area is where Customers come after their flights.
  </p>

  <h2>6. What is PPE?</h2>
  <p>
    PPE stands for Personal Protective Equipment. Before going to the ramp, make sure you wear your PPE. 
    The basic PPE kit includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Ramp Safety Jacket</li>
      <li>Ramp Safety Shoes</li>
      <li>Earplugs</li>
      <li>Cap</li>
       <li>Hand Gloves</li>
      <li>Face Shiled</li>
      <li>Rainwear</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>Staff handling baggage must also wear <strong>Safety Gloves</strong> to protect their hands while loading or unloading.</ul>
    <ul>Noise is an invisible hazard. Always ensure that we wear earplugs at airside. Eg: Hotel Mode in ATR.</ul>
  </p>
  <img src="img/ppe.jpeg" alt="" class="standard-img">

  <h2>7. What to Do if Something Feels Wrong</h2>
  <p>
    If something doesn’t feel right or looks unsafe, report it immediately. 
    A quick safety check is always better than ignoring a problem. 
    Speaking up can prevent accidents.

  <h2>10. Equipment and Vehicles</h2>
  <p>
    Various specialized equipment and vehicles are essential for smooth airside operations. Each has a specific role to support aircraft handling and passenger movement efficiently and safely.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Passenger Coach:</strong> Shuttles Customers between the terminal and aircraft, avoiding traffic delays.</li>
    <li><strong>Trestle:</strong> Connects ATR aircraft to ground crew, providing a smooth three-step transition.</li>
    <li><strong>BFL (Baggage Freight Loader):</strong> Moves luggage and cargo onto planes, preventing manual heavy lifting.</li>
    <li><strong>TUG:</strong> Acts like a tow truck for aircraft, pushing or pulling planes and moving trolleys around.</li>
    <li><strong>Passenger Ramp:</strong> A sturdy staircase for boarding Airbus 320/321 aircraft.</li>
    
    <li><strong>APU (Auxiliary Power Unit):</strong> Supplies power to the aircraft when engines are off.</li>
    <li><strong>GPU (Ground Power Unit):</strong> Provides external power to aircraft on the ground.</li>
    <li><strong>Water Cart:</strong> Refills the plane’s water supply.</li>
    <li><strong>Toilet Cart:</strong> Maintains aircraft sanitation by servicing toilets.</li>
    <li><strong>Water Cart and Toilet Cart allocations to be handled by separate staffs. Interchanging allocations in between shift is not allowed due to safety reasons.</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Baggage Trolley:</strong>Used to load bags from the BMA and cargo from the cargo terminal. A maximum of five trolleys can be connected to a TUG at a time. All trolley doors must be closed and secured before connecting to the TUG.</li>

    <li>
      The BFL should always be started outside the ERA (Equipment Restraint Area). When initiated, there is a possibility of smoke or sparks being emitted. If the BFL is started inside the ERA, particularly near the aircraft holds, the smoke may enter the hold area. This can trigger the smoke detectors installed on the ceiling of the holds, leading to a false fire alarm in the cockpit.

  <h2>11. Safety Signs</h2>
  <p>
    Safety signs at the airside are important to direct vehicles, personnel, and aircraft safely around the ramp area. These signs help prevent accidents and ensure smooth operations.
  </p>
  <img src="img/safetysigns.png" alt="Airside Markings" class="standard-img" >
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service Road:</strong> Signs marking the paths where ground vehicles should travel.</li>
    <li><strong>ERA (Equipment Restraint Area):</strong> Zones where equipment must be parked or secured safely.</li>
    <li><strong>Center Line:</strong> Lines guiding aircraft and vehicles along safe routes.</li>
    <li><strong>Stop Point:</strong> Designated stopping locations for vehicles or aircraft.</li>
    <li><strong>Tail Clearance Line:</strong> Marks safe clearance distances behind aircraft.</li>
    <li><strong>Taxiway:</strong> Routes designated for aircraft to move between runways and gates.</li>
    <li><strong>Runway:</strong> Marked areas where aircraft take off and land.</li>
    <li><strong>Manuvering Area:</strong> Combination of Runway and Taxiway.</li>
    <li><strong>Apron:</strong> Combination of bays.</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>12. Aerobridge and Passenger Ramp Alignment</h2>
  <p>
    An aerobridge is a movable, telescopic corridor that connects the airport terminal directly to the aircraft door. It allows Customers to board and deboard safely and comfortably without going outside.
  </p>
  <img src="./img/Aerobridge_1.png" alt="Aerobridge" class="standard-img">
  <p>
    It is strictly prohibited to stand inside the aerobridge while it is moving. This is because the moving parts can cause injuries, similar to standing on a fast-moving conveyor belt.
  </p>
  <p>
    Parking vehicles or equipment beneath the aerobridge is not allowed due to the risk of the bridge lowering or moving unexpectedly, which could cause damage or injury.
  </p>
  <p>
    The passenger ramp has a “no-touch” policy to avoid damaging the aircraft door. A gap of approximately 2 inches from the door and 7 inches below it must be maintained. This ensures smooth and safe boarding operations without causing damage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aircraft marshallers play a key role in guiding aircraft safely to the gate or parking position. They use hand signals and maintain a safe stopping distance of about 3 feet from the aircraft to prevent collisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important to always follow the marshaller’s directions and never rush the parking process. Safety is the highest priority at all times.
  </p>
</section>




<section>
  <h2>13. Wing Walking and Marshalling</h2>
  <p>Wing walking involves guiding aircraft safely during pushback and taxiing. The wing walker acts as the eyes and ears on the ground, ensuring the plane moves smoothly without hitting obstacles.</p>
  <p>It is essential to stay at least 1 meter (3 feet) from the wingtip to avoid injury and maintain safety. Wing walking is mandatory both day and night because aircraft require careful guidance regardless of visibility.</p>
  <p>Wing walkers work closely with the marshaller and pushback tractor driver as part of a coordinated team, providing crucial signals and safety oversight.</p>
  <p>Although the center line and stop point markings guide aircraft parking, wing walkers are necessary because planes lack side mirrors, so they check for obstacles near the wings.</p>

  <h2>14. Types of Aircraft Parking Bays</h2>
  <p>There are different types of parking bays used for aircraft depending on how the plane will move next.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pushback Bay:</strong> The aircraft is prepared to be moved by a tug. Wing walkers signal the marshaller during this process.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Out Bay:</strong> The aircraft taxis out under its own power without a tug. Wing walkers give signals directly to the cockpit crew.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Clear communication and signaling ensure smooth and safe aircraft movement in both bays.</p>

  <h2>15. Visual Docking Guidance System (VDGS)</h2>
  <p>The Visual Docking Guidance System (VDGS) acts like a GPS for aircraft on the ground, helping pilots park precisely in the correct spot.</p>
  <p>The marshaller plays a key role by standing near the emergency stop button, always visible to the Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (AME), ready to stop operations if necessary. This ensures maximum safety during docking.</p>
  <p>Marshallers use hand signals to guide the aircraft safely and prevent collisions, acting like traffic controllers on the tarmac.</p>
